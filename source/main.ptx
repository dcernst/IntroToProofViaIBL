<title>Preface</title>
<p>
Mathematics is not about calculations, but ideas.
My goal as a teacher is to provide students with the opportunity to grapple with these ideas and to be immersed in the process of mathematical discovery.
Repeatedly engaging in this process hones the mind and develops mental maturity marked by clear and rigorous thinking.
Like music and art,
mathematics provides an opportunity for enrichment,
experiencing beauty, elegance, and aesthetic value.
The medium of a painter is color and shape,
whereas the medium of a mathematician is abstract thought.
The creative aspect of mathematics is what captivates me and fuels my motivation to keep learning and exploring.
</p>

<p>
While the content we teach our students is important, it is not enough.
An education must prepare individuals to ask and explore questions in contexts that do not yet exist and to be able to tackle problems they have never encountered.
It is important that we put these issues front and center and place an explicit focus on students producing,
rather than consuming, knowledge.
If we truly want our students to be independent,
inquisitive, and persistent,
then we need to provide them with the means to acquire these skills.
Their viability as a professional in the modern workforce depends on their ability to embrace this mindset.
</p>

<p>
When I started teaching, I mimicked the experiences I had as a student.
Because it was all I knew, I lectured.
By standard metrics, this seemed to work out just fine.
Glowing student and peer evaluations,
as well as reoccurring teaching awards,
indicated that I was effectively doing my job.
People consistently told me that I was an excellent teacher.
However, two observations made me reconsider how well I was really doing.
Namely, many of my students seemed to depend on me to be successful,
and second, they retained only some of what I had taught them.
In the words of Dylan Retsek:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<q>Things my students claim that I taught them masterfully, they don't know.</q>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Inspired by a desire to address these concerns, I began transitioning away from direct instruction towards a more student-centered approach.
The goals and philosophy behind inquiry-based learning (IBL) resonate deeply with my ideals,
which is why I have embraced this paradigm.
According to the Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning, IBL is a method of teaching that engages students in sense-making activities.
Students are given tasks requiring them to solve problems,
conjecture, experiment, explore, create,
and communicate<mdash/>all those wonderful skills and habits of mind that mathematicians engage in regularly.
This book has IBL baked into its core.
</p>

<p>
This book is intended to be a task sequence for an introduction to proof course that utilizes an IBL approach.
The primary objectives of this book are to:
<ul>
<li><p>Expand the mathematical content knowledge of the reader,</p></li>
<li><p>Provide an opportunity for the reader to experience the profound beauty of mathematics,</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the reader to exercise creativity in producing and discovering mathematics,</p></li>
<li><p>Enhance the ability of the reader to be a robust and persistent problem solver.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, this is really a book about productive struggle and learning how to learn.
Mathematics is simply the vehicle.

\epigraph{Much more important than specific mathematical results are the habits of mind used by the people who create those results.
<ellipsis/> Although it is necessary to infuse courses and curricula with modern content,
what is even more important is to give students the tools they will need in order to use,
understand,
and even make mathematics that does not yet exist.}{Cuoco, Goldenberg, &amp; Mark in

The first draft of this book was written in 2009.
At that time,
several of the sections were adaptations of course materials written by Matthew Jones (CSU Dominguez Hills) and Stan Yoshinobu (University of Toronto).
The current version of the book is the result of many iterations that involved the addition of new material,
retooling of existing sections,
and feedback from instructors that have used the book.
The current version of the book is a far cry from what it looked like in 2009.
</p>

<p>
This book has been an open-source project since day one.
Instructors and students can download the PDF for free and modify the source as they see fit.
Several instructors and students have provided extremely useful feedback,
which has improved the book at each iteration.
Moreover, due to the open-source nature of the book, I have been able to incorporate content written by others.
Below is a partial list of people
(alphabetical by last name)
that have contributed content, advice, or feedback.

<li><p>
<url href="https://math.depaul.edu/cdrupies/">Chris Drupieski</url>,
<url href="http://math.depaul.edu/tpeter21/">T.<nbsp/>Kyle Petersen</url>,
and
<url href="http://math.depaul.edu/bridget/">Bridget Tenner</url>
(DePaul University).
Modifications that these three made to the book inspired me to streamline some of the exposition,
especially in the early chapters.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<url href="http://www.paulellis.org">Paul Ellis</url>
(Rutgers University).
Paul has provided lots of useful feedback and several suggestions for improvements.
Paul suggested problems for <xref ref="chap_Induction">Chapter</xref>
and provided an initial draft of <xref ref="sec_Images_and_Preimages">Section</xref>: Images and Preimages of Functions.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<url href="http://jasongrout.org">Jason Grout</url>
(Bloomberg, L.P.).
I am extremely grateful to Jason for feedback on early versions of this manuscript,
as well as for helping me with a variety of technical aspects of writing an open-source textbook.

Anders is the original author of the content in <xref ref="appendix_elements_of_style">Appendix</xref>: Elements of Style for Proofs.
The current version in <xref ref="appendix_elements_of_style">Appendix</xref>

(CSU Dominguez Hills) and
<url href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/cms/people/faculty/yoshinobu-stan/">Stan Yoshinobu</url>
(University of Toronto).
A few of the sections were originally adaptations of notes written by Matt and Stan.
Early versions of this textbook relied heavily on their work.
Moreover, Matt and Stan were two of the key players that contributed to shaping my approach to teaching.

When I was transitioning to an IBL approach to teaching, Carol was one of my mentors and played a significant role in my development as a teacher.
Moreover, this work is undoubtedly influenced my Carol's excellent book
<em>Chapter Zero: Fundamental Notions of Advanced Mathematics</em>,
which I used when teaching my very first IBL course.
