      In this chapter, we introduce mathematical induction,
      which is a proof technique that is useful for proving statements of the form <m>(\forall n \in \mathbb{N})P(n)</m>,
      or more generally <m>(\forall n \in \mathbb{Z})(n\geq a\implies P(n))</m>,
      where <m>P(n)</m> is some predicate and <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
