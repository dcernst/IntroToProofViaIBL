  <title>Injective and Surjective Functions</title>
  <p>
    We now turn our attention to some important properties that a function may or may not possess.
    Recall that if <m>f</m> is a function,
    then every element in its domain is mapped to a unique element in the range.
    However, there are no restrictions on whether more than one element of the domain is mapped to the same element in the range.
    If each element in the range has a unique element in the domain mapping to it,
    then we say that the function is injective.
    Moreover, the range of a function is not required to be all of the codomain.
    If every element of the codomain has at least one element in the domain that maps to it,
    then we say that the function is surjective.
    Let's make these definitions a bit more precise.

    How do we prove that a function <m>f</m> is injective?
    We would need to show that every element in the range has a unique element from the domain that maps to it.
    First, notice that each element in the range can be written as <m>f(x)</m> for at least one <m>x</m> in the domain.
    To argue that each such element in domain is unique,
    we can suppose <m>f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})</m> for arbitrary <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> in the domain and then work to show that <m>x_{1}=x_{2}</m>.
    It is important to point out that when we suppose
    <m>f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})</m> for some <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m>,
    we are not assuming that <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are different.
    In general, when we write
    <q>Let <m>x_1,x_2\in X</m><ellipsis/></q>, we are leaving open the possibility that <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are actually the same element.
    One could approach proving that a function is injective by utilizing a proof by contradiction,
    but this is not usually necessary.

        The function diagram for <m>\varphi</m> is given in <xref ref="fig_passengers">Figure</xref>, where we have highlighted the elements of the domain that map to the same element in the range by enclosing them in additional boxes.
        We see that <m>\range(\varphi)=\{1,2,4\}</m>.
        The function diagram for the induced map
        <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> that is depicted in <xref ref="fig_airplanes">Figure</xref> makes it clear that <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> is a bijection.
        Note that since <m>\varphi(a)=\varphi(b)</m> and <m>\varphi(d)=\varphi(e)=\varphi(f)</m>,
        it must be the case that <m>[a]=[b]</m> and
        <m>[d]=[e]=[f]</m> according to <xref ref="thm_related_if_and_only_if_same_class">Theorem</xref>.
        Thus, the vertices labeled as <m>[a]</m> and <m>[d]</m> in <xref ref="fig_airplanes">Figure</xref> could have also been labeled as <m>[b]</m> and <m>[c]</m> or <m>[d]</m>,
        respectively.
        In terms of our passengers and airplanes analogy,
        <m>X=\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}</m> is the set of passengers,
        <m>Y=\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> is the set of potential destination cities,
        <m>X/\mathord\sim=\{[a],[c],[d]\}</m> is the set of airplanes,
        and <m>\range(\varphi)=\{1,2,4\}</m> is the set of cities that airplanes land at.
        The equivalence class <m>[a]</m> is the airplane containing the passenger <m>a</m>,
        and since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are on the same plane,
        <m>[b]</m> is also the plane containing the passenger <m>a</m>.
