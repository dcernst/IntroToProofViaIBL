  <p>
    Recall from <xref ref="sec_Cartesian_Products">Section</xref>
    that the Cartesian product of two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
    written <m>A\times B</m>,
    is the set of all ordered pairs <m>(a,b)</m>,
    where <m>a\in A</m> and <m>b\in B</m>.
    That is, <m>A\times B=\{(a,b)\mid a\in A, b\in B\}</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.
        A <term>relation</term> <m>R</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is a subset of <m>A \times B</m>.
        If <m>R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> and <m>(a,b)\in {R}</m>,
        then we say that <m>a</m> is <term>related to</term> <m>b</m> and we may write
        <m>\tcboxmath{aR b}</m> in place of <m>(a,b)\in{R}</m>.
        If <m>R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to the same set <m>A</m>,
        then we say that <m>R</m> is a <term>relation on</term> <m>A</m>.

    </statement>

      <p>
        The set <m>\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{R}</m> from <xref ref="prob_some_lines">Problem</xref>
        is an example of a relation on <m>\mathbb{R}</m> since
        <m>\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{R}</m> is a subset of <m>\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    It is important to notice that the order in which we write things for relations matters.
    In particular,
    if <m>R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> and <m>a R b</m>,
    then it may or may not be the case that <m>bR a</m>.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="ex_relation_finite_to_finite">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A=\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m> and <m>B=\{1,2,3,4\}</m>,
        then the set of ordered pairs
        <me>
          R=\{(a,1),(a,2),(a,4),(c,2),(d,2),(e,2),(e,4)\}
        </me>
        is an example of a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
        In this case, we could write <m>(c,2)\in{R}</m> or <m>cR 2</m>.
        We could also say that <m>a</m> is related to 1, 2, and 4.

        As in the previous example, let <m>A=\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m>.
        One possible relation on <m>A</m> is given by

  <example xml:id="ex_Twitter">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the set of accounts <m>A</m> on the social media platform Twitter.
        On Twitter, each account has a set of accounts that they follow.
        We can model this situation mathematically using a relation on <m>A</m>.
        Define <m>T</m> on <m>A</m> via <m>xTy</m> if <m>x</m> follows <m>y</m> on Twitter.
        As a set
        <me>
          T=\{(x,y)\in A\times A\mid x\text{ follows } y\text{ on Twitter } \}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        You are already familiar with many relations.
        For example, <m>=</m>, <m>\leq</m>,
        and <m>\lt</m> are each examples of relations on the real numbers.
        We could say that <m>(3,\pi)</m> is in the relation <m>\leq</m> and the relation <m>\lt</m> since <m>3\leq \pi</m> and <m>3\lt \pi</m>.
        However, <m>(3,\pi)</m> is not in the relation <m>=</m> since <m>3\neq \pi</m>.
        Also, notice that order matters for the relations <m>\leq</m> and <m>\lt</m> yet does not for <m>=</m>.
        For example,
        <m>(-\sqrt{2}, 4)</m> is in the relation <m>\leq</m> while <m>(4,-\sqrt{2})</m> is not.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Define the relation <m>S</m> from <m>\{-1,1\}</m> to
        <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> via <m>1Sx</m> if <m>x</m> is even and <m>-1Sx</m> if <m>x</m> is odd.
        That is, <m>1</m> is related to all even integers and <m>-1</m> is related to all odd integers.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be any set.
        Since <m>\emptyset \subseteq A\times A</m>,
        the empty set forms a relation on <m>A</m>.
        This relation is called the <term>empty relation</term> on <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Relations can be represented using digraphs.
    A <term>digraph</term>
    (short for <term>directed graph</term>)
    is a discrete graph that consists of a set of vertices connected by edges,
    where the edges have a direction associated with them.
    If <m>R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>,
    then the elements of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are the vertices of the digraph and there is a directed edge from <m>a\in A</m> to <m>b\in B</m> if <m>(a,b)</m> is in the relation <m>R</m> (i.e., <m>aR b</m>).
    We can visually represent digraphs by using dots to represent the vertices and arrows to represent directed edges.
    We will not make a distinction between a digraph and its visual representation.
    Utilizing a digraph to represent a relation may be impractical if there is a large number of vertices or directed edges.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the relation given in <xref ref="ex_relation_finite_to_finite">Example</xref>.
        The corresponding digraph is depicted in <xref ref="fig_digraph_finite_to_finite">Figure</xref>.
        Notice that we have placed the vertices corresponding to elements of <m>A</m> on the left and the elements of <m>B</m> on the right.
        This is standard practice,
        but what really matters is the edge connections not how the vertices are placed on the page.

        Let <m>A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m> and
        <m>B=\{1,2,3,4\}</m> and define <m>D</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> via

  <p>
    If <m>R</m> is a relation on <m>A</m> (i.e., a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m>),
    then we can simplify the structure of the digraph by only utilizing one copy of <m>A</m> for the vertices.
    In this case,
    we may have directed edges that point from a vertex to itself.
    When drawing digraphs for a relation on a set,
    we will default to this simplified digraph
    (like the one depicted in <xref ref="fig_digraphB">Figure</xref>).

    For a relation on a set,
    it is natural to consider the collection of elements that a given element is related to.
    For example, a user's
    <q>Following List</q>
    on Twitter is the set of accounts on Twitter that the user is following.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_relatives">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a relation on a set <m>A</m>.
        For each <m>a\in A</m>,
        we define the <term>set of relatives of <m>a</m> with respect to <m>R</m></term> via
        <me>
          \tcboxmath{\rel(a,R)\coloneqq \{b\in A\mid aR b\}}

  <p>
    If <m>R</m> is clear from the context,
    we will usually write <m>\tcboxmath{\rel(a)}</m> in place of <m>\rel(a,R)</m>.
    In terms of digraphs,
    <m>\rel(a)</m> is the collection of vertices that have a directed edge pointing towards them from the vertex labeled by <m>a</m>.
    In graph theory, this collection of vertices is called the

    of <m>a</m> and each such vertex is called an <term>out neighbor</term>.
    Notice that <m>\Rel(R)</m> is a set of sets.
    In particular,
    an element in <m>\Rel(R)</m> is a subset of <m>A</m><mdash/>equivalently,
    an element of <m>\mathcal{P}(A)</m>.

        One thing to keep in mind is that the elements used in the definitions of symmetric and transitive do not have to be distinct.
        So, you might need to consider multiple cases.

<p>Below, we provide skeleton proofs for proving that a relation is reflexive, symmetric, or transitive. Notice that the skeleton proof for proving that a relation is reflexive is a special case of <xref ref="skeleton_for_all">Skeleton Proof</xref>. Similarly, the skeleton proofs involving symmetric and transitive are both special cases of <xref ref="skeleton_for_all_direct_proof">Skeleton Proof</xref>. It is important to point out that every relation on the empty set is vacuously reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. In the skeleton proofs below, we are implicitly assuming that the set in question is nonempty. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to mention the possibility of the empty set.</p>
