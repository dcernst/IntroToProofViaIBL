<title>Introduction to Quantification</title>
<p>
In this section and the next,
we introduce <term>first-order logic</term><mdash/>also referred to as
<term>predicate logic</term>,
<term>quantificational logic</term>,
and <term>first-order predicate calculus</term>.
The sentence
<q><m>x>0</m></q>
is not itself a proposition because its truth value depends on <m>x</m>.
In this case, we say that <m>x</m> is a <term>free variable</term>.
A sentence with at least one free variable is called a <term>predicate</term>
(or <term>open sentence</term>).
To turn a predicate into a proposition,
we must either substitute values for each free variable or
<q>quantify</q>
the free variables.
We will use notation such as <m>\tcboxmath{P(x)}</m> and
<m>\tcboxmath{Q(a,b)}</m> to represent predicates with free variables <m>x</m> and <m>a,b</m>,
respectively.
The letters
<q><m>P</m></q>
and
<q><m>Q</m></q>
that we used in the previous sentence are not special;
we can use any letter or symbol we want.
For example,
each of the following represents a predicate with the indicated free variables.
<ul>
  <li>
<p>
  <m>S(x)\coloneqq</m> <q><m>x^2-4=0</m></q>
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>
  <m>L(a,b)\coloneqq</m> <q><m> a\lt b</m></q>
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>
  <m>F(x,y)\coloneqq</m> <q><m>x \text{ is friends with } y</m></q>
</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

  <p>
Note that we used quotation marks above to remove some ambiguity.
What would <m>S(x)=x^2-4=0</m> mean?
It looks like <m>S(x)</m> equals 0, but actually we want <m>S(x)</m> to represent the whole sentence
<q><m>x^2-4=0</m></q>. Also, notice that the order in which we utilize the free variables might matter.
For example, compare <m>L(a,b)</m> with <m>L(b,a)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
One way we can make propositions out of predicates is by assigning specific values to the free variables.
That is, if <m>P(x)</m> is a predicate and <m>x_0</m> is specific value for <m>x</m>,
then <m>P(x_0)</m> is now a proposition that is either true or false.
  </p>
  <problem>
<statement>
  <p>
Consider <m>S(x)</m> and <m>L(a,b)</m> as defined above.
Determine the truth values of <m>S(0)</m>, <m>S(-2)</m>,
<m>L(2,1)</m>, and <m>L(-3,-2)</m>.
Is <m>L(2,b)</m> a proposition or a predicate?
  </p>
</statement>
  </problem>
  <p>
Besides substituting specific values for free variables in a predicate,
we can also make a claim about which values of the free variables apply to the predicate.
  </p>
  <problem xml:id="ex_quantified_predicates">

Both of the following sentences are propositions.
Decide whether each is true or false.

<q>For all</q>

<q>there exists<ellipsis/> such that</q>
is the <term>existential quantifier</term>.
  </p>
</statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
In mathematics, the phrases
<q>for all</q>,
<q>for any</q>,
<q>for every</q>, and
<q>for each</q>
can be used interchangeably
(even though they might convey slightly different meanings in colloquial language).
We can replace
<q>there exists<ellipsis/> such that</q>
with phrases like
<q>for some</q>
(possibly with some tweaking of the wording of the sentence).
It is important to note that the existential quantifier is making a claim about
<q>at least one</q>, <em>not</em>
<q>exactly one.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
Variables that are quantified with a universal or existential quantifier are said to be <term>bound</term>.
To be a proposition, <em>all</em>
variables of a predicate must be bound.
  </p>
  <p>
We must take care to specify the collection of acceptable values for the free variables.
Consider the sentence
<q>For all <m>x</m>, <m>x>0</m>.</q>
Is this sentence true or false?
The answer depends on what set the universal quantifier applies to.
Certainly, the sentence is false if we apply it for all <m>x\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
However, the sentence is true for all <m>x\in\mathbb{N}</m>.
Context may resolve ambiguities,
but otherwise, we must write clearly:
<q>For all <m>x\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>x>0</m></q>
or
<q>For all <m>x\in\mathbb{N}</m>, <m>x>0</m>.</q>
The collection of intended values for a variable is called the
<term>universe of discourse</term>.
  </p>
  <problem>
<statement>
  <p>
Suppose our universe of discourse is the set of integers.
<ol marker="labeltextrmalph">

  is true.

  <p>
If a predicate has more than one free variable,
then we can build propositions by quantifying each variable.
However, <em>the order of the quantifiers is extremely important!</em>

<statement>
  <p>
Let <m>P(x,y)</m> be a predicate with free variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in a universe of discourse <m>U</m>.
One way to quantify the variables is
<q>For all <m>x \in U</m>,
there exists <m>y \in U</m> such that <m>P(x,y)</m>.</q>
How else can the variables be quantified?

Suppose the universe of discourse is the set of people and consider the predicate <m>M(x,y)\coloneqq</m> <q><m>x\text{ is married to } y</m></q>.
We can interpret the formal statement
<q>For all <m>x</m>, there exists <m>y</m> such that <m>M(x,y)</m></q>
as meaning
<q>Everybody is married to somebody.</q>
Interpret the meaning of each of the following statements in a similar way.

There are a couple of key points to keep in mind about quantification.
To be a proposition, all variables must be quantified.
This can happen in at least two ways:
<ul>
  <li>
<p>
  The variables are explicitly bound by quantifiers in the same sentence.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>
  The variables are implicitly bound by preceding sentences or by context.
  Statements of the form
  <q>Let <m>x=\ldots</m></q>
  and
  <q>Assume <m>x\in\ldots</m></q>
  bind the variable <m>x</m> and remove ambiguity.
</p>
  </li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
Also, the order of the quantification is important.
Reversing the order of the quantifiers can substantially change the meaning of a proposition.
  </p>
  <p>
Quantification and logical connectives (
<q>and,</q>
<q>or,</q>
<q>If<ellipsis/>, then<ellipsis/>,</q>
and
<q>not</q>
) enable complex mathematical statements.
For example,
if <m>f</m> is a function while <m>c</m> and <m>L</m> are real numbers,
then the formal definition of <m>\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=L</m>,
which you may have encountered in calculus, is:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
For all <m>\varepsilon >0</m>, there exists <m>\delta >0</m> such that for all <m>x</m>, if <m>0\lt |x-c|\lt \delta</m>, then <m>|f(x)-L|\lt \varepsilon</m>.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
In order to study the abstract nature of complicated mathematical statements,
it is useful to adopt some notation.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_quantifiers">
<statement>
  <p>
The universal quantifier
<q>for all</q>
is denoted <m>\tcboxmath{\forall}</m>,
and the existential quantifier
<q>there exists<ellipsis/> such that</q>
is denoted <m>\tcboxmath{\exists}</m>.
  </p>
</statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
Using our abbreviations for the logical connectives and quantifiers,
we can symbolically represent mathematical propositions.
For example, the (true) proposition
<q>There exists <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>x^2-1=0</m></q>
becomes
<q><m>(\exists x \in \mathbb{R})(x^2-1=0)</m>,</q>
while the (false) proposition
<q>For all <m>x\in \mathbb{N}</m>,
there exists <m>y\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>y\lt x</m></q>
becomes
<q><m>(\forall x\in\mathbb{N})(\exists y\in\mathbb{N})(y\lt x)</m>.</q>

Convert the following propositions into statements using only logical and mathematical symbols.
Assume that the universe of discourse is the set of real numbers.
<ol marker="labeltextrmalph">
  <li>
<p>
  There exists <m>x</m> such that <m>x^2+1</m> is greater than zero.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>
  There exists a natural number <m>n</m> such that <m>n^2=36</m>.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>
  For every <m>x</m>, <m>x^2</m> is greater than or equal to zero.
</p>
  </li>

  <problem>
<statement>
  <p>
Express the formal definition of a limit
(given above <xref ref="def_quantifiers">Definition</xref>)
in logical and mathematical symbols.
  </p>
</statement>
  </problem>
  <p>
If you look closely,
many of the theorems that we have encountered up until this point were of the form <m>A(x)\implies B(x)</m>,
where <m>A(x)</m> and <m>B(x)</m> are predicates.
For example,
consider <xref ref="thm_n_even_implies_n_2_even">Theorem</xref>,
which states, <q>If <m>n</m> is an even integer,
then <m>n^2</m> is an even integer.</q> In this case,
<q><m>n</m> is an even integer</q>
and
<q><m>n^2</m> is an even integer</q>
are both predicates.
So, it would be reasonable to assume that the entire theorem statement is a predicate.
However, it is standard practice to interpret the sentence
<m>A(x)\implies B(x)</m> to mean <m>(\forall x)(A(x)\implies B(x))</m>
(where the universe of discourse for <m>x</m> needs to be made clear).
We can also retool such statements to
<q>hide</q>
the implication.
In particular,
<m>(\forall x)(A(x)\implies B(x))</m> has the same meaning as <m>(\forall x \in U')B(x)</m>,
where <m>U'</m> is the collection of items from the universe of discourse <m>U</m> that makes <m>A(x)</m> true.
For example,
we could rewrite the statement of <xref ref="thm_n_even_implies_n_2_even">Theorem</xref> as
<q>For every even integer <m>n</m>, <m>n^2</m> is even.</q>
  </p>
  <problem>

Reword <xref ref="thm_sum_of_three_consecutive_integers">Theorem</xref>

To whet your appetite for the next section,
consider how you might prove a true proposition of the form

If a proposition is false, then its negation is true.
How would you go about negating a statement involving quantifiers?
