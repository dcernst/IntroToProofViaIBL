  <title>The Well-Ordering Principle</title>
  <p>
    The penultimate theorem of this chapter is known as the
    <term>Well-Ordering Principle</term>.
    As you shall see,
    this seemingly obvious theorem requires a bit of work to prove.
    It is worth noting that in some axiomatic systems,
    the Well-Ordering Principle is sometimes taken as an axiom.
    However, in our case, the result follows from complete induction.
    Before stating the Well-Ordering Principle,
    we need an additional definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A\subseteq \mathbb{R}</m> and <m>m\in A</m>.
        Then <m>m</m> is called a <term>maximum</term>
        (or <term>greatest element</term>)
        of <m>A</m> if for all <m>a\in A</m>, we have <m>a\leq m</m>.
        Similarly, <m>m</m> is called <term>minimum</term>
        (or <term>least element</term>)
        of <m>A</m> if for all <m>a\in A</m>, we have <m>m\leq a</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  
<p>Not surprisingly, maximums and minimums are unique when they exist. It might be helpful to review <xref ref="skeleton_uniqueness">Skeleton Proof</xref> prior to attacking the next result.</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>If <m>A\subseteq \mathbb{R}</m> such that the maximum (respectively, minimum) of <m>A</m> exists, then the maximum (respectively, minimum) of <m>A</m> is unique.</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>If the maximum of a set <m>A</m> exists, then it is denoted by <m>\tcboxmath{\max(A)}</m>. Similarly, if the minimum of a set <m>A</m> exists, then it is denoted by <m>\tcboxmath{\min(A)}</m>.</p>

  <problem xml:id="prob_find_max_and_min">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the maximum and the minimum for each of the following sets when they exist.

    To prove the Well-Ordering Principle,
    consider a proof by contradiction.
    Suppose <m>S</m> is a nonempty subset of
    <m>\mathbb{N}</m> that does not have a least element.
    Define the proposition <m>P(n)\coloneqq</m>
    <q><m>n</m> is not an element of <m>S</m></q>
    and then use complete induction to prove the result.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_WOP">
    <title>Well-Ordering Principle</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a least element.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    It turns out that the Well-Ordering Principle
    (<xref ref="thm_WOP">Theorem</xref>)
    and the Axiom of Induction
    (<xref ref="axiom_induction">Axiom</xref>)
    are equivalent.
    In other words,
    one can prove the Well-Ordering Principle from the Axiom of Induction,
    as we have done,
    but one can also prove the Axiom of Induction if the Well-Ordering Principle is assumed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The final two theorems of this section can be thought of as generalized versions of the Well-Ordering Principle.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_generalized_WOP">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> is a nonempty subset of the integers and there exists <m>l\in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that
        <m>l\leq a</m> for all <m>a\in A</m>,
        then <m>A</m> contains a least element.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_reverse_WOP">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> is a nonempty subset of the integers and there exists
        <m>u\in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>a\leq u</m> for all <m>a\in A</m>,
        then <m>A</m> contains a greatest element.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    The element <m>l</m> in <xref ref="thm_generalized_WOP">Theorem</xref>
    is referred to as a <term>lower bound</term>
    for <m>A</m> while the element <m>u</m> in <xref ref="thm_reverse_WOP">Theorem</xref> is called an
    <term>upper bound</term> for <m>A</m>.
    We will study lower and upper bounds in more detail in <xref ref="sec_AxiomsRealNumbers">Section</xref>.
